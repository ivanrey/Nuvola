Nuvola
======

Nuvola is a Jukebox for YouTube for public places. It allows you to use credits to play songs from different
devices connected to the network and it streams the music directly from YouTube. It's meant as a replacement
for traditional coin jukeboxes in pubs and bars for a cloud based library with zero day music deployments.
